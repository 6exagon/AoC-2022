# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to 2022's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022), written in 100% standard C. Each day/challenge will have one standalone program to compile, and it will be intended to solve the second (harder) iteration of the problem. Supporting files will be included when necessary, but programs take input through stdin.

And no, this code will not be well-commented, elegant, or necessarily safe on all architectures, though with input conforming to the specification any undefined behavior is unintended. Implementation-defined behavior is also only used within reason.
